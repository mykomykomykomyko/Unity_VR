# Unity in VR: how does it work?

**Unity** is a cross-platform game engine that is commonly used to develop *virtual reality (VR) experiences*. Unity provides a powerful set of tools for building interactive 3D environments, including support for VR headsets, hand controllers, and other VR hardware. To develop a VR experience in Unity, you can use the engine's built-in VR support to create 3D scenes and add interactivity using scripts.
